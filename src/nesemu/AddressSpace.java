/* The NES is made up of many different components (CPU, PPU, game cartridge,
 * controllers, system memory, etc.) and they are connected via an address space.
 * A device connected to an address space may be written to or read from by any
 * other device in the address space. See https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/CPU_memory_map
 *
 * Note that some memory locations and ports may be accessed from more than one
 * memory address, depending on the way the 16-bit addresses are decoded within
 * each device; this is known as "mirroring":
